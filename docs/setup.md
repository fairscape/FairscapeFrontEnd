# Install Instructions

---

The GUI client is distributed as a binary application, therefore no installation is required. Download the latest instance of the FAIRSCAPE GUI Client from our [releases](https://github.com/fairscape/FairscapeGUIClient/releases) page that matches your operating system. Simply run the application and you are good to go!

Note: Linux users may need to enable the `Execute` permission from the file properties before running the application.
