# fairscape-gui-client

---

A utility for packaging objects and metadata for FAIRSCAPE.

## Features

FAIRSCAPE GUI Client provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the client side to create [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) - a light-weight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.
The GUI allows users to:

- Create Research Object Crates ([RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/))
- Add (transfer) digital objects to the RO-Crate
- Register metadata of the objects
- Describe the schema of tabular dataset objects as metadata
- Upload RO-Crates to the FAIRSCAPE server
