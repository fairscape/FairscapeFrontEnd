# fairscape-gui-client

---

A utility for packaging objects and metadata for FAIRSCAPE.

## Features

fairscape-gui provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the client side to create:

- [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) - a light-weight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. The GUI allows users to:
  - Create Research Object Crates (RO-Crates)
  - Add (transfer) digital objects to the RO-Crate
  - Register metadata of the objects
  - Describe the schema of tabular dataset objects as metadata
  - Upload RO-Crates to a Fairscape instance
