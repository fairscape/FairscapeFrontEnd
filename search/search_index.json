Only authorized users are allowed to publish the RO-Crates to the FAIRSCAPE server after logging in. Creatino and packaing of RO-Crates can be performed in a local machine in isolation. Internet connection is required only when a user is ready to publish. The opening interface shows the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Step 0: Prep Folder for RO-Crate Initialization</li> <li>Step 1: Initialize an RO-Crate</li> <li>Step 2: Register files in your RO-Crate</li> <li>Step 3: Review the contents of your RO-Crate</li> <li>Step 4: Package an RO-Crate for upload</li> <li>Step 5: Upload an RO-Crate</li> </ul> <p>Select any of these steps to begin the process.
